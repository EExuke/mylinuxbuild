Tested on APLGS120GTPOE with tftpd32(sntp server) and DNS server

* steps:

1. set DUT and IPv4 and IPv6 network segment same with servers
2. config DUT DNS IPv4&IPv6 Server to dns server PC's IP
3. config DUT "system time" mode to SNTP, "SNTP Primary Server" to "time-server.cn"

* result:

1. DNS server can reach DNS IPv4 query pkt, and DNS server will reply the
   request with response type A & SOA(start of a zone of Authority).
   replied IPv4 address is SNTP v4 server IP: 10.3.4.27
2. DUT will send sntp v4 query to 10.3.4.27 and sntp server will reply the time.
3. DUT will get a new time.

* Undetermined problem(SNTP IPv6 action ?)

DNS only record IPv4 address to cache, so SNTP only send ntp-query by IPv4 source address;
but if record IPv6 and IPv4 both, SNTP will always send IPv6 request to server, because
SNTP sending request will be sent priority with IPv6, and DNS IPv6 response got ok.
