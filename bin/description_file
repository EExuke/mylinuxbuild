DNS: fix after upgrading the IPv6 function of DNS, SNTP does not valid.

[Cypress][Fix][SNTP][Major][I#13652][M#23937]
bug  : 0023937: [TPE#60680] [DNS] The DUT DNS IPv4 does not valid.
cause: After upgrading the IPv6 function of DNS module,
       the processing of resolve host name is changed accordingly,
       which results in that SNTP module can not get the correct
       server IP through the original resolve processing,
       and SNTP module will no longer send request packets to the
       sntp server.
solve: Use FsUtlIPvXResolveHostName instead of FsUtlResolveHostName
       to get server IP through host name.
